The BitShares AGS Campaign has successfully ended at UTC 2014-07-19 00:00:00.

I hope AGSExplorer.com has been useful for you during the period.  You can view donation summary at <%= root_url %>.

AGSExplorer.com will continue operation, you can still view your balance at the site.  I will track upcoming DAC snapshot announcements and show you your shares balance based on that information.

I am also planning to apply for BitShares Delegate.  If you like what AGSExplorer.com has been providing, please continue supporting me, and I hope I can continue contributing to the community.

To vote for me as delegate, please issue the following command in your BitShares client, or simply do this in your web wallet GUI when BitShares client software is officially released.
